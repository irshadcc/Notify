# Highlighter
A simple chrome extension that allows the highlighting of text on webpages with a simple right-click (or keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shfit+H). Saves all highlights so they can be re-highlighted when a webpage is reopened!

Available for [download on the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/highlighter/fdfcjfoifbjplmificlkdfneafllkgmn).
